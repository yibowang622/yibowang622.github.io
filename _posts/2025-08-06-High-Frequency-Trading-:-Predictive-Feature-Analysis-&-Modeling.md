A comprehensive analysis of engineered features for short-term price prediction in financial markets

### üéØ Executive Summary
<p align="justify">
This project demonstrates a complete quantitative research workflow for high-frequency trading (HFT) signal development. Using 7 days of 1-second market data with 86 engineered features, I developed a predictive model achieving 15.96% correlation with future returns and identified 20.9% improvement potential through regime-aware trading.
</p>

**üéØ Key Insight:** The 1-second horizon provides 7.5% mean correlation compared to just 1.4% at 60 seconds - a 5x improvement in signal strength.

### üîç Part 1: Feature Exploration & Selection
### Methodology

I implemented an adaptive feature selection strategy based on cross-horizon correlation analysis:
<pre>
# Calculate correlations across all prediction horizons
horizons = [1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60]  # seconds
all_correlations = {}

for h in horizons:
    ret_col = f'ret_{h}s'
    corrs = df[feature_cols].corrwith(df[ret_col]).abs().dropna()
    all_correlations[h] = corrs

# Select features based on average correlation
avg_correlation = pd.DataFrame(all_correlations).mean(axis=1)
selected_features = avg_correlation.nlargest(50).index.tolist()
</pre>

### Results

|---------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1s      | 7.50%            | 12.20%          | 50                  | **3.204**     |
| 2s      | 6.90%            | 11.20%          | 50                  | 3.102         |
| 5s      | 4.90%            | 7.80%           | 50                  | 2.881         |
| 10s     | 3.50%            | 6.00%           | 50                  | 2.811         |
| 30s     | 1.80%            | 3.60%           | 42                  | 2.384         |
