### Introduction
This project presents a complete end-to-end trading system that integrates financial news sentiment analysis, technical indicator-based stock screening, and machine learning probability forecasts.

The goal is to construct a multi-layered decision pipeline that replicates realistic quantitative trading workflows:

* ðŸ“š Scraping financial news articles with Scrapy

* ðŸ’¬ Analyzing sentiment using FinBERT transformer model

* ðŸ“ˆ Screening stocks using technical indicators (RSI, MACD)

* ðŸ¤– Forecasting market movement probabilities using a Transformer-based model

* ðŸŽ¯ Generating final trade signals through a double-threshold logic combining Sentiment + Alpha + ML prediction

* ðŸ”„ Backtesting and evaluating strategy performance using Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, and Total Returns

This approach simulates institutional research methodology, enhancing the robustness and interpretability of trading decisions.

### 1. Sentiment Analysis and Aggregation
We scrape financial news articles using Scrapy and apply the FinBERT model to generate sentiment scores for each article.

The complete scraping results can be viewed in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/yibowang622/5f109ca7a5cf6f5a3e2b69e7dc66946f).

To align sentiment with stock trading decisions, we aggregate sentiment scores for each stock over the past 7 days by calculating the average confidence score for positive sentiment. Only stocks with a 7-day average sentiment score greater than 0.5 are considered for further selection.

### 2. Technical Indicator Screening
After identifying stocks with positive sentiment, we apply a multi-factor technical screening process to filter for promising trading opportunities. This stage combines sentiment analysis with traditional technical indicators to generate a comprehensive trading signal.

The screening process integrates:

* RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify oversold or overbought conditions
* MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to detect momentum shifts
* SMA50 (50-day Simple Moving Average) as a trend filter
* Volume analysis for confirmation of price movements

Our implementation includes robust error handling and rate limiting protection to ensure reliable data collection from financial APIs.

**Sample Results:**

| Ticker | Sentiment | Articles | RSI | MACD_Bullish | Above_SMA50 | Avg_Volume |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|
| BA     | 1.00      | 1        | 48.3 | Yes         | Yes         | 8792622    |
| BRK    | 1.00      | 1        | 52.7 | Yes         | Yes         | 5077701    |
| AMZN   | 0.96      | 1        | 56.8 | Yes         | No          | 49614533   |
| DB     | 0.67      | 2        | 45.2 | Yes         | Yes         | 4239758    |
| META   | 0.67      | 1        | 62.1 | Yes         | No          | 18266843   |
| NVS    | 0.50      | 2        | 41.9 | Yes         | Yes         | 2484374    |

### 3. Alpha Model Construction
The core of our trading strategy is a weighted alpha model that combines sentiment signals with technical indicators. This approach creates a robust scoring system that prioritizes stocks with the highest probability of positive performance.

Our alpha model assigns weights to different components:

* Sentiment score (40%): News sentiment from our FinBERT analysis
* RSI score (20%): Normalized inverse RSI for oversold conditions
* MACD score (20%): Binary signal for bullish crossovers
* Volume score (20%): Relative volume compared to 30-day average

The mathematical formulation of our alpha score is:

```python
score = (
    sentiment_score * 0.4 +
    volume_score * 0.2 +
    rsi_score * 0.2 +
    macd_score * 0.2
)
```

This weighted approach allows us to rank stocks by their combined technical and sentiment signals, creating a daily watchlist of high-potential trading candidates.

**Sample Results:**

| Ticker | alpha_score |
|--------|-------------|
| BA     | 0.800       |
| BRK    | 0.800       |
| DB     | 0.668       |
| NVS    | 0.600       |
| AMZN   | 0.584       |
| META   | 0.468       |

### 4. Machine Learning Probability Forecasts

To enhance our decision-making process, we implement a Transformer-based machine learning model that generates probability forecasts for directional price movements. This model is trained on historical price patterns and calculates the probability of upward price movement.

Our ML model architecture includes:
* A Transformer encoder with multi-head attention
* Sequence length of 20 days
* Two primary features: price returns and momentum
* Binary classification output (probability of price increase)

**Implementation Files:**
- [Transformer ML Model (transform_model.py)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15M9wl1AWaBM-SZkpoTxyILCabBoD5CoO?usp=sharing)

**Sample Results:**

| Ticker | P_up    | Best_Threshold | F1_Score | AUC      | Data_Source |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| BA     | 0.517137| 0.5            | 0        | 0.485358 | Historic    |
| BRK    | 0.533452| 0.5            | 0        | 0.477690 | Historic    |
| DB     | 0.519094| 0.5            | 0        | 0.489465 | Historic    |
| NVS    | 0.480948| 0.5            | 0        | 0.517180 | Historic    |
| AMZN   | 0.470642| 0.5            | 0        | 0.512692 | Historic    |
| META   | 0.484280| 0.5            | 0        | 0.461475 | Historic    |

[Download ML Predictions](/data/ml_predictions.csv)

The model provides probability values for upward movement (P_up) and model performance metrics (AUC). These outputs serve as the final validation layer in our multi-factor decision pipeline.

### 5. Trading Signal Generation

The final step in our pipeline combines all previous layers into actionable trading signals. We implement a multi-threshold approach that filters stocks across multiple dimensions:

1. **Alpha Score**: The weighted combination of sentiment and technical indicators must exceed 0.6
2. **ML Predictions**: Probability of upward movement (P_up) must exceed 0.51
3. **ML Quality**: The model's AUC (area under curve) must exceed 0.48

**Implementation Files:**
- [Pipe Combine Alpha + ML Scores (combine.py)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CjxCpVEwIyMBiA27LfA9D54EZsl5LqtL?usp=sharing)

The pipeline combines these signals through this simple yet effective code:

```python
# Merge alpha scores with ML predictions
combined = pd.merge(alpha_df, ml_df, on='Ticker', how='inner')

# Apply multi-threshold filtering
final_watchlist = combined[
    (combined['P_up'] > 0.51) &
    (combined['AUC'] > 0.48) &
    (combined['alpha_score'] > 0.6)
]
```

**Final Trading Signals:**

| Ticker | Sentiment | Articles | RSI   | MACD_Bullish | Above_SMA50 | alpha_score | P_up     | AUC      |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|--------------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| BA     | 1.0       | 1        | 82.06 | Yes          | Yes         | 0.8         | 0.517137 | 0.485358 |
| DB     | 0.67      | 2        | 89.24 | Yes          | Yes         | 0.668       | 0.519094 | 0.489465 |

[Download Final Signals](/data/final_signals.csv)

After applying all filters, our pipeline identifies BA and DB as the top trading opportunities. These stocks have passed multiple validation layers:

1. **Strong sentiment**: Both show positive news sentiment
2. **Technical strength**: Both have bullish MACD and are above their 50-day moving averages
3. **High alpha scores**: Both exceed our 0.6 alpha score threshold
4. **ML confirmation**: Both have predicted upward probability > 0.51

This multi-layered approach ensures we only trade stocks that have received validation from multiple independent analysis methods.

### 6. Backtesting and Performance Evaluation

The final step in our pipeline is to evaluate the performance of our trading strategy through comprehensive backtesting. We implemented a systematic approach with the following parameters:

- **Initial Capital**: $10,000
- **Position Size**: $1,000 per trade
- **Risk Management**: 2% stop-loss, 4% take-profit
- **Entry Criteria**: P_up > 0.5, RSI > 50, MACD > 0
- **Holding Period**: Maximum 5 days per position

**Implementation Files:**
- [Backtesting Script (backtest.py)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1BDxGgawRXBra4NDiTyQte-M_94XwxFe4?usp=sharing)

**Backtest Results:**

| Ticker | P_up     | Return | CAGR  | Sharpe | Max_Drawdown | Win_Rate | Trades | Winning_Trades |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------|--------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| BA     | 0.517137 | 9.87%  | 12.93%| 4.29   | 2.44%        | 57.3%    | 89     | 51             |
| DB     | 0.519094 | 6.80%  | 8.87% | 2.93   | 3.20%        | 50.0%    | 100    | 50             |

[Download Backtest Results](/data/backtest_results.csv)

The backtest results demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach:

1. **Positive Returns**: Both stocks showed positive returns in the backtest period
2. **Strong Risk-Adjusted Performance**: Sharpe ratios of 4.29 and 2.93 indicate excellent return per unit of risk
3. **Low Drawdowns**: Maximum drawdowns remained below 3.5%, showing good capital preservation
4. **Consistent Win Rates**: Both stocks maintained win rates of 50% or higher

**Equity Curves:**

![BA Equity Curve](/assets/images/BA_equity_curve.png)
*Boeing (BA) - Equity Curve with 9.9% Return, 4.29 Sharpe Ratio, and 2.4% Max Drawdown*

![DB Equity Curve](/assets/images/DB_equity_curve.png)
*Deutsche Bank (DB) - Equity Curve with 6.8% Return, 2.93 Sharpe Ratio, and 3.2% Max Drawdown*

What's particularly notable in the equity curves is the strong performance in the latter part of the trading period. Both stocks show a period of consolidation followed by significant upward momentum, suggesting the strategy is able to preserve capital during sideways markets while capitalizing effectively on emerging trends.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of combining sentiment analysis, technical indicators, and machine learning in a unified trading framework. By processing financial news through NLP techniques and integrating this data with technical analysis, we create a more holistic view of potential trading opportunities.

Key findings include:
* Sentiment analysis provides valuable leading indicators for price movements
* Technical indicators help filter and time entry points
* The combined approach reduces false positives and improves risk-adjusted returns
* Backtesting shows consistent positive performance with limited drawdowns

The multi-layered approach of our pipeline - from sentiment analysis to technical screening to machine learning validation - creates a robust system that successfully identifies high-potential trading opportunities while maintaining strong risk management.

### Future Improvements

Several areas could enhance this trading system further:
1. **Expanded News Sources**: Incorporating a wider variety of financial news sources
2. **Alternative Data Integration**: Adding social media sentiment, earnings call transcripts, and insider trading data
3. **Advanced ML Architectures**: Implementing attention mechanisms specifically tuned to financial time series
4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Developing position sizing based on conviction levels and correlations
5. **Adaptive Parameters**: Creating dynamic thresholds that adjust to market volatility regimes

This project serves as a foundation for production-ready quantitative trading systems that combine traditional financial analysis with modern NLP and machine learning techniques.
