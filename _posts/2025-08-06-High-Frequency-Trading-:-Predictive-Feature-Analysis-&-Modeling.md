### üìä Dataset Overview

**Data Specifications:**

### üîç Part 1: Feature Exploration & Selection
### Methodology

I implemented an adaptive feature selection strategy based on cross-horizon correlation analysis:
<pre>
# Calculate correlations across all prediction horizons
horizons = [1, 2, 5, 10, 30, 60]  # seconds
all_correlations = {}

for h in horizons:
    ret_col = f'ret_{h}s'
    corrs = df[feature_cols].corrwith(df[ret_col]).abs().dropna()
    all_correlations[h] = corrs

# Select features based on average correlation
avg_correlation = pd.DataFrame(all_correlations).mean(axis=1)
selected_features = avg_correlation.nlargest(50).index.tolist()
</pre>

### Results

* **Available Features:** 86 total engineered features
* **Selected Features:** 50 features using correlation-based selection
* **Top Feature:** 5e7e5a691e with 6.98% average correlation
* **Selection Criteria:** Features showing consistent predictive power across multiple horizons

### Feature Characteristics
The selected features exhibit diverse statistical properties:

* **Price-like features:** 12 features with positive ranges and moderate variance
* **Return-like features:** 18 features centered around zero
* **Ratio-like features:** 15 features bounded between -1 and 1
* **Volume-like features:** 5 features with high variance and positive skew

### ‚è±Ô∏è Part 2: Prediction Horizon Analysis
### Signal Decay Investigation

I analyzed how predictive power varies across different time horizons:

| Horizon | Mean Correlation | Max Correlation | Significant Features | Quality Ratio |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1s      | 0.0418          | 0.1218          | 47                 | **2.89**     |
| 2s      | 0.0401          | 0.1156          | 44                 | 2.71         |
| 5s      | 0.0378          | 0.1089          | 41                 | 2.58         |
| 10s     | 0.0352          | 0.1012          | 38                 | 2.34         |
| 30s     | 0.0309          | 0.0887          | 32                 | 2.12         |
| 60s     | 0.0276          | 0.0798          | 28                 | 1.91         |

### Key Findings

1.**Optimal Horizon:** 1-second predictions provide the best signal-to-noise ratio
2.**Decay Pattern:** Gradual degradation of predictive power over longer horizons

4.**Quality Assessment:** 1-second horizon offers excellent balance of strength and consistency

### Visualization Insights

* **Mean correlation** decreases monotonically with horizon length
* **Number of significant features** drops from 47 to 28 across horizons
* **Signal stability** remains high even as absolute correlation declines

### ü§ñ Part 3: Prediction Model Construction
### Model Comparison

I evaluated three machine learning approaches using proper time series cross-validation:

| Model | CV Correlation | CV MSE | Stability | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Ridge** | **0.1596 ¬± 0.008** | 0.000847 | High | **Best Overall** |
| Linear | 0.1591 ¬± 0.009 | 0.000848 | High | Close Second |  
| Random Forest | 0.1542 ¬± 0.012 | 0.000851 | Medium | Slight Overfitting |

### Composite Signal Development

I created two approaches to signal combination:

### 1. Correlation-Weighted Signal
