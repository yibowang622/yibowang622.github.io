### ðŸš€ Introduction
In this project, I've implemented a transformer-based binary classifier to predict daily price movements for Apple (AAPL) stock using historical data from 2020 to 2023. The approach demonstrates how advanced deep learning architectures originally developed for natural language processing can be adapted for financial time series forecasting with promising results.
