### Introduction
QuantWolf is a sophisticated end-to-end automated trading pipeline that combines machine learning, sentiment analysis, and technical indicators to identify high-conviction stock trading opportunities. Built with modularity and scalability in mind, it processes real-time financial data to generate actionable trading signals.
The system operates through a comprehensive 12-step pipeline that seamlessly integrates multiple data sources and analytical frameworks. QuantWolf employs a unique dual-strategy approach: analyzing Yahoo Finance sector indices (^YH311, ^YH103, etc.) and industry-level performance metrics to identify trending sectors, then drilling down to individual stocks within high-performing industries. The pipeline combines MACD momentum analysis, multi-period return calculations (1D, 5D, 15D, 30D), and market weight assessments to create composite industry rankings.
At its core, QuantWolf leverages a custom Transformer-based binary classifier with enhanced architecture (48 d_model, 6 attention heads, 3 encoder layers) that processes 18 sophisticated technical features including Bollinger Bands, MACD histograms, volatility ratios, and microstructure indicators. The model predicts across multiple timeframes (1-day direction, 3-day direction, and magnitude-based moves) with AUC optimization and confidence-based thresholding. This is enhanced by real-time sentiment analysis using GPT-4 integration with CNBC news scraping, extracting per-stock bullish/bearish sentiment scores that serve as confirmation signals.
What sets QuantWolf apart is its hierarchical filtering approach: starting with 11 major Yahoo Finance sectors (^YH311-^YH207), ranking key industries using proprietary dual-strategy scoring (combining momentum scores up to 7.0 points and stability scores up to 6.0 points), then selecting individual tickers within winning industries. The system demonstrated impressive results in walk-forward validation with 87.5% win rate and 12.7% average period returns, though v1.0 includes look-ahead bias that will be addressed in production v2.0.
Each component is designed as an independent module, allowing for rapid strategy iteration and A/B testing. The pipeline processes everything from sector analysis to executable trading signals with comprehensive backtesting (253% total returns in historical testing) and rigorous walk-forward validation ensuring statistical robustness. This architecture enables both systematic strategy development and production-ready automated execution.
